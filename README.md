# Password-MANAGER

there are some python lib to be installled:

pip or pip3 install cryptography==2.2(older works best for me if you want a new version go the the site and check)
pip of pip3 install pyperclip
the default passoword is = "codeit"
to change it type --h to get a list of commands and change it accordingly
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR VISITING!!
